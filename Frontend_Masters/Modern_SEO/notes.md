traditional seo

- unique and targeted content: find your niche 
- richness of content: supplement text with media and vice versa
- recency bias: frequent updates, remove broken links
- link building: want influential sites to link to your site
- keyword stuffing: no longer works

business with a physical location
 - complete google my business page
 - ask for reviews and display on your website - build social proof
 - local business directories - chamber of commerce, moz.com/local
 - correct errors/outdated info quickly
 - acquire local backlinks from vendors and partners
 - geographic targeting in google search console

 - quality of a site is proportional to the number of links to it
 - value of a link on a quality site is worth more

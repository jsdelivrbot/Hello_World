## You Don't Know JS

[You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) is a book series by Kyle Simpson that provides an in-depth explanation of the fundamental concepts underpinning JavaScript. This [repo](./You_Don't_Know_JS) contains notes and practice exercises I completed while reading the books.

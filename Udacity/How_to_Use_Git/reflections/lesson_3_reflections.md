**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**

When you are collaborating on your project with other people or when you want to share your work.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**

You may not want GitHub to overwrite changes you've made locally but not committed yet.

**Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?**

Fork - Make copy a GitHub repository over from somebody else's account into your account.
Clone - Copy down an existing repository locally.
Branch - Diverge from the master branch within the same repository.

**What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?**

This will reduce code conflicts when you push/merge your changes in. It will also ensure that you do not omit changes that other members of your team may have made.

**How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?**

You could exchange your code changes in another way like emailing back and forth, or working on the same code base. These methods do not easily allow for version control or simultaneous work on the same code.

**When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?**

When adding a new feature or experimenting you would want build and test it in a branch first. Similarly, if multiple team members are working on the same code base it may help to avoid conflicts.
